# Index of my contract's versions:

v0.0 = OpenZeppelin presets, not modified.
v0.1 = Unnecessary presets features commented out (transfer-related functions).
v0.2 = Anyone can mint for free + Each ticket/NFT minted gets its Metadata/tokenUri setup while being minted (for now, all NFTs have the same image metadata).
v0.3 = Adding payment condition for minting => Now, sneaky users who haven't paid shouldn't be able to mint.
